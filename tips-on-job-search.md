  **highlights:**

  * https://github.com/j-delaney/easy-application - list of companies with easy application process

  * **send emails directly to real people with each application.**

    "whenever I submitted an application, I searched for the company on LinkedIn and emailed someone on their engineering or hiring team."
  * possible email format: firstName@dreamCompany.com or firstName.lastName@dreamCompany.com
  * **Plan to tackle easier interviews early on and more difficult ones later on.**
  * resources for preparing:

    * https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions - list of front-end Questions

  * "During interviews, ask the following questions:
    * What are some technical challenges you’ve recently faced?
    * What do you enjoy about working at X company?
    * How are teams structured and how are tasks usually divided?"
  * Prepare for the long game and make sure you take care of yourself.
