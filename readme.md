# Resume and network

## Intro

Finding job and proving my skills is a problem for me, cause I'm shy and new to American job market. And to job market in general, to be honest. Now that I feel more confident with my programming skills and more like a part of a tech community, I think it's time to address the issue of future job search.

## Goals for this Friday project

* Research tips on job search.
* Research design principles for resumes.
* **Learn about applicant tracking systems.**
* **Research open source repos to contribute to and mention on resume.**
* **Research tips and popular topics for interviews.**
* Research and add people to linkedin network.

## Results

By the end of the day I research following topics:
* [tips on job search](tips-on-job-search.md)
* [applicant tracking systems](applicant-tracking-systems.md)
* [contributing to open source](contributing-to-open-source.md)

Also found several open source projects, that I'm interested in:

## To do in the future

In the future I'm planning to:
* go through preparing materials, mentioned in "tips on job search". (probably not once)
* contribute to open source projects I found
* construct resume, using the information I found
